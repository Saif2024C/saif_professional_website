# Mohammad Saifullah

MSc Mathematical Modelling & Scientific Computing  
Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford  

**RL • Optimisation • Scientific ML • Computational Modelling**

I work on mathematically grounded, data-driven models for complex physical and financial systems. My interests include reinforcement learning for control and finance, physics-informed machine learning, stochastic modelling, and kernel methods for structured prediction.

Currently exploring:
- Reinforcement learning for discrete-time option hedging using policy gradients
- Image colourisation via vector-valued kernel ridge regression  
- Stochastic modelling of cell migration  
- Physics-informed neural networks for battery degradation
